    "explanation": "**Separating hyperplane** is the correct answer because in a perceptron model, the decision boundary that divides different classes of data is mathematically defined as a hyperplane. In the context of linear classification, this hyperplane represents the geometric boundary where the perceptron's linear function equals zero (wÂ·x + b = 0). For 2D data, this appears as a line; for 3D data, it's a plane; and for higher dimensions, it's called a hyperplane. This boundary separates the input space into regions corresponding to different classes, making it the fundamental concept that defines how a perceptron classifies data points.\n\n**Decision line** is incorrect because while this term might seem intuitive for 2D cases, it's not the standard mathematical terminology used in machine learning. The perceptron model operates in potentially high-dimensional spaces, and \"decision line\" is too restrictive as it only applies to two-dimensional cases. The correct term must encompass all dimensional scenarios.\n\n**Activation function** is incorrect because this refers to the mathematical function that determines the perceptron's output based on its input (commonly a step function or sign function). The activation function processes the weighted sum of inputs to produce a classification decision, but it is not the geometric boundary itself that separates the classes.\n\n**Weight vector** is incorrect because this represents the parameters (coefficients) that define the orientation and position of the separating hyperplane, not the boundary itself. The weight vector, along with the bias term, determines where the hyperplane is positioned in the feature space, but the vector itself is not the decision boundary that separates the classes.",
