        "correct_answer_explanation": "In the context of a perceptron model, the decision boundary that separates different classes of data is called a **separating hyperplane**. A perceptron is a fundamental building block of neural networks, designed for binary classification. It works by finding a linear boundary that can divide the input data points into two distinct categories. In a 2-dimensional space (like a graph with X and Y axes), this boundary is a straight line. In a 3-dimensional space, it's a flat plane. When we talk about spaces with more than three dimensions (which is common in machine learning when dealing with many features), this linear boundary is generalized to a 'hyperplane'. The term 'hyperplane' is a general mathematical concept for a flat, (n-1)-dimensional subspace within an n-dimensional space. For a perceptron, this hyperplane is precisely what defines the decision rule: data points on one side of the hyperplane belong to one class, and points on the other side belong to the second class. This concept is central to understanding how a perceptron performs linear classification.",

The term 'separating hyperplane' is a more general and accurate term that applies to any number of dimensions (2, 3, or more). A line is a specific case of a hyperplane (a 1-dimensional hyperplane in a 2-dimensional space). Since the question asks for the general term in the context of a perceptron, 'separating hyperplane' is the most appropriate and comprehensive answer. Choosing 'decision line' might indicate a limited understanding of how these concepts scale to higher dimensions."

            "distractor": "Activation function",
            "explanation": "An 'activation function' is a crucial component of a perceptron, but it is not the decision boundary itself. The activation function (like a step function) determines the output of the perceptron based on the weighted sum of its inputs. It takes the result of the linear combination of inputs and weights and transforms it into the final output (e.g., 0 or 1, or -1 or 1), effectively making the decision based on which side of the boundary the input falls. However, it is the mathematical equation of the hyperplane that defines *where* that boundary is, not the activation function. The activation function acts *on* the output of the linear combination that defines the hyperplane."

These weights, along with a bias term, define the orientation and position of the separating hyperplane. In essence, the weight vector is a *component* that helps to define the hyperplane, but it is not the hyperplane itself. The hyperplane is the geometric boundary, while the weight vector is a set of parameters that mathematically describe that boundary. Confusing the weight vector with the decision boundary suggests a misunderstanding of the roles of different components within the perceptron model."

The 'separating hyperplane' is the general term for this linear decision boundary, which can be a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, or a hyperplane in higher dimensions. Understanding this term is fundamental to grasping how perceptrons perform linear classification and forms the basis for more complex neural network architectures.",

Think of 'hyperplane' as the general term for this separator, regardless of how many features (dimensions) your data has. Remember that the 'activation function' is like the 'switch' that makes the final decision based on which side of the hyperplane the data falls, and the 'weight vector' is what *defines* the hyperplane's position and angle. Drawing simple 2D examples can be very helpful. For Week 6 of INT3405, focus on understanding these basic definitions as they are the building blocks for more advanced topics in machine learning."

In this scenario, the perceptron incorrectly classified a positive example (actual label y = 1) as negative (predicted label y_hat = -1).

The update rule for a misclassified positive example (y = 1, y_hat = -1) is to add a scaled version of the input 'x' to the weights 'w' and add a scaled constant to the bias 'b'. Specifically, the update rules are: w = w + alpha * x and b = b + alpha. The learning rate 'alpha' controls the step size of these adjustments, ensuring that the updates are not too drastic.

A Perceptron is designed to make a definitive 'yes' or 'no' decision. It uses a step function (or sign function) as its activation, which means if the weighted sum of inputs exceeds a certain threshold, it outputs one class (e.g., 1), and if it falls below, it outputs the other (e.g., 0 or -1). There's no 'maybe' or 'likelihood' involved; it's a direct, hard classification. In contrast, Logistic Regression uses the sigmoid (or logistic) function as its activation. This function squashes the weighted sum of inputs into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability that an input belongs to the positive class. For example, an output of 0.75 means there's a 75% chance it's the positive class. To get a hard classification from Logistic Regression, you typically apply a threshold (e.g., if probability > 0.5, classify as 1; otherwise, 0), but its direct output is a probability score.",

When the penalty for misclassification is high, the model becomes less tolerant of errors on the training data. To avoid these high penalties, the SVM will try harder to classify all training points correctly, even if it means finding a separating hyperplane with a smaller (narrower) margin. This behavior is analogous to a hard-margin SVM, where no misclassifications are allowed, resulting in a potentially narrower margin to perfectly separate the data.

        "name": "SVM Parameter Trade-offs and Generalization",
        "description": "This cross-week topic integrates the understanding of SVM parameters (like the regularization parameter 'C' from Week 6 and potential kernel parameters like gamma for RBF kernels) with the concept of generalization error and bias-variance trade-off from Week 2. MCQs can require students to analyze how changes in these parameters affect model complexity, training error, and generalization performance.",
